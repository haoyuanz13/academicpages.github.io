Implemented two of important robotics required algorithms.
1. **Polynomial Trajectory Planning and Generation**: design and generate an optimal polynomial smooth trajectory for the Quad rotor given a specified 3D Map. *[`source code`](https://github.com/haoyuanz13/Visual_SLAM/tree/master/Trajectory%20Generation)*
2. **Hand-handled Camera Calibration**: aimed to estimate the intrinsic (K) and extrinsic (R, t) matrices for the camera using a planer world space(e.g. checkerboard) and multiple views, and optimized all variables using the reprojection errors. *[`source code`](https://github.com/haoyuanz13/Visual_SLAM/tree/master/cameraCalibration)*
