1. Within this project, we implemented the Visual Inertial Odometry to estimate the states of a Quadrotor, including its global position [x, y, z], pose [roll, pitch, yaw] and linear velocity with respected to the world [vx, vy, vz].     
2. We achieved both simulation on Linux/ROS and lab environment test on a real Quadrotor tasks.
