Mastered the algorithm and implementation of most generative models, including AE, VAE and multiple GANs.    
1. Implemented **AE(Auto-Encoder)** and **VAE(Variational AutoEncoder)** on people face data, e.g. cufs human faces. *[`source code`](https://github.com/haoyuanz13/Deep_Learning/tree/master/Generative%20Model/AE_VAE)*
2. Researched on most popular **GANs** model, including DCGAN, WGAN and WGAN-GP, also wrote a detailed report to discuss their properties. *[`source code`](https://github.com/haoyuanz13/Deep_Learning/tree/master/Generative%20Model/GAN)*
3. Applied basic GAN model to more complicated problem, **Image-to-Image Translation**, my implementations included **[cGAN](https://github.com/haoyuanz13/Deep_Learning/tree/master/Generative%20Model/Im2ImTrans)** and **[cycleGAN](https://github.com/haoyuanz13/Deep_Learning/tree/master/Generative%20Model/cycleGAN_im2im)**.
