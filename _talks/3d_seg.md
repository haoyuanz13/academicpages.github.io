*[`source code`](https://github.com/haoyuanz13/Deep_Learning/tree/master/3D%20Object%20Segmentation)*      
Built a deep network to achieve the 3D-MNIST data classification, 3D bounding box estimation and cube plane depth estimation.   
1. 3D Data (3D MNIST) Pre-Processing, including the Voxel generation and 2D multiple views generation.
2. Deep network construction which can estimate class label, depth map and 2D bbox in one single stage.
3. 3D bounding box estimation.
