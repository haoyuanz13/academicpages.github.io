Implemented some of the most popular used machine learning algorithms and applied them into the real robot cases.  
1. **Object Detection and Geometry distance estimation based on GMM**: trained some GMMs based on the image color data, also combined image processing and geometry algorithms to detetct any read barrel in a robot's view and estimate its real geometry distance from robot. *[`source code`](https://github.com/haoyuanz13/Machine_Learning_in_Robotics/tree/master/object_detection_GMM)*
