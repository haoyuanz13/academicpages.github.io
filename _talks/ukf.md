1. `Succeeded in implementing a Kalman filter to track three-dimensional orientation of a hand-handled camera.`      
2. `Given IMU sensor readings from gyroscopes and accelerometers, the algorithm will estimate the underlying 3D orientation by learning the appropriate model parameters from ground truth data given by a Vicon motion capture system.`
3. `Generated a real-time panoramic image using images captured by the camera and information filtered by the 3D orientation filter.`
