`Happy to have u here! 感谢来访！`


Start with who I am
------------------
Welocome to Haoyuan's world! My full name is Haoyuan Zhang, and feel free to call me Steve. What's more, 张皓原 is my name represented by the Chinese character. My hometown is a beautiful island, named **[Zhoushan Islands](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%88%9F%E5%B1%B1%E7%BE%A4%E5%B2%9B)**, located at the East China Sea near Shanghai. I spent all my childhood and school life there up to 18 years old.


Education Life
--------------
After my graduation from **@[Zhejing Zhoushan High School](http://www.zjzszx.cn)** in June, 2012, I went to Beijing, China for my four-year undergraduate program **@[Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/)**, major in Electrical Engineering. 

At my senior year in 2015, I got an admission of Exchange Program from **@[The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/web/en/home/index.html)**, learning Computer Science and HCI(Human-Computer Interaction). At June, 2016, I finished my undergraduate program and obtained the Bachelor Degree in Science Engineering.     

That same year, I got an offer from the **@[University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/)**, major in Robotics, Master Program. Supervised by **[Dr. Jianbo Shi](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/)**, my main research and interests are about computer vision, also a lover of the 3D Vision issue, including the Structure from Motion, Visual Slam and AR algorithm. 

After two-year learning and working **@[GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/)**, I became experienced in both traditional and modern computer vision (deep learning based) algorithms, also with strong coding ability. Finally, I received my first **[Master Degree](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/haoyuan-zhang)** at May, 2018.
