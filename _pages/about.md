`Happy to have u here! 感谢来访！`


Start with who I am
------------------
Welocome to Haoyuan's world! My full name is Haoyuan Zhang, and feel free to call me Steve. What's more, 张皓原 is my name represented by the Chinese character. My hometown is a beautiful island, named **[Zhoushan Islands](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%88%9F%E5%B1%B1%E7%BE%A4%E5%B2%9B)**, located at the East China Sea near Shanghai. I spent all my childhood and school life there up to 18 years old.


Education Life
--------------
After my graduation from **@[Zhejing Zhoushan High School](http://www.zjzszx.cn)** in June, 2012, I went to Beijing, China for my four-year undergraduate program **@[Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/)**, major in Electrical Engineering. 

At my senior year in 2015, I got an admission of Exchange Program from **@[The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/web/en/home/index.html)**, learning Computer Science and HCI(Human-Computer Interaction). At June, 2016, I finished my undergraduate program and obtained the Bachelor Degree in Science Engineering.     

That same year, I got an offer from the **@[University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/)**, major in Robotics, Master Program. Supervised by **[Dr. Jianbo Shi](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/)**, my main research and interests are about computer vision, also a lover of the 3D Vision issue, including the Structure from Motion, Visual Slam and AR algorithm. 

After two-year learning and working **@[GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/)**, I became experienced in both traditional and modern computer vision (deep learning based) algorithms, also with strong coding ability. Finally, I received my first **[Master Degree](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/haoyuan-zhang)** at May, 2018. 

Feel free to check my `detailed resume` [here](https://haoyuanz13.github.io/cv/) and `research project work` [here](https://haoyuanz13.github.io/talks/).


What I am doing now ...
-----------------------
Currently I am working as an Algorithm Engineer at the Smart Mobility R&D team **@[Horizon Robotics](http://en.horizon.ai/)**, Beijing, China. My main responsibiliy is on the vision-based object detection, classification and 3D Box estimation, which match my background very well. 

Looking forward to receiving more ideas and connections about those topics!


More about me
-------------
During my spare time after work, I love sports very much, including basketball, fitness, skiing and sleeping lol ... 

In addition, I enjoy reading and watching some detective-involved materials, such as some detective stories especailly brought by **[Keigo Higashino 东野圭吾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keigo_Higashino)**, and the video **[Signal](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(%E9%9B%BB%E8%A6%96%E5%8A%87))** is highly recommended! Welcome to show your ideas if you are also interested in those stuffs! 

Also, I keep posting some good and interesting photos [here](https://haoyuanz13.github.io/portfolio/) and hope you will like some of them :)
